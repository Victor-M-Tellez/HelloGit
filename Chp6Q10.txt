Part A:
given the following input 

Set A |11|1|3|1|
Set B |10|1|4|4|


The above algorithm will pick the following: {A,A,A,A}
This has a value of 11+1+3+1=16

However we can see that the Optimun picks are: {A,Move,B,B}
This has the following values 11+0+4+4= 19
This shows that the provided algorithm does not always return the optimun result.




Part B:
I will use Wa(i) for the amount of work we can get done at time i on machine A.
I will use Wb(i) for the amount of work we can get done at time i on machine B.
There are two cases in this problem:
Case1: we start at machine A 
Case2: we start at machine B

From there we always have two options of where we will find the correct solution given we are in iteration i:
Option1: We stay at the same machine that we are currently at for iteration i+1
Option2: We decide to move taking in 0 work for the next iteration and can only work during iteration i+2

I can then define 2 recurcive funtions one for each case
Case1:
Base case: OPTa(1)=A(1)
OPTa(i)=A(i)+ Max(OPTa(i-1), OPTb(i-2))

Case2:
Base case: OPTb(1)=B(1)
OPTb(i)=B(i)+ Max(OPTb(i-1), OPTa(i-2))

We assume that any value for i<1 returns 0 in both set A and B

We can then return Max(OPTa(n), OPTb(n)) which will be the value of the optimal plan
