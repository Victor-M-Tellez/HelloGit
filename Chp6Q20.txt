I will be using ideas from the Subset Sums and Knapsack portion of the textbook
We set the values to be
n = number of courses/ number of final projects
W= the number of hours I have to complete the projects before they are due
vi= to Grade given to me on project i after spending w hours on it AKA fi(h)

Now we want a subsetS of maximun value SUM(vi for all i that are in S).
Also Sum(of all weights wi for all i that are in S)< W
GRADE(n,W):
	Array M[0..n, 0..W]
	initialize M[0,w]= 0 for each w= 0,1,...,W
	For i = 1,2..,n
		For w=0,...,W
			For j=0,...,W
			vi= fi(j)
			If w< wi 
				OPT(i,w)=OPT(i-1,w)
			Else
				OPT(i,w)=Max(OPT(i-1,w), vi+OPT(i-1, w-wi))
			ENDIF
		EndFor
		EndFor
	EndFor

Return M[n,W]
